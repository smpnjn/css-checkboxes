# checkboxes

This is a bunch of checkboxes for use in CSS. Most of these can be achieved with CSS only, but some use Javascript. For all, there is a hidden input with the value of the checkbox (called .hidden-value). This input can be a number between 0 and 1, 1 being completely checked, 0 being unchecked, and any other number being some % complete.

Similarly, you can access the current value of the input through the data-value attribute on the .checkbox-container element.
